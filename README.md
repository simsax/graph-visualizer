# graph-visualizer
A tool to visualize graph algorithms.

## Edit (10 months later)
I am revisiting some of my old stuff. This project is incomplete and it doesn't actually visualize
any algorithm. 
It was more of an exploration into graph drawing, along with an attempt to create my own immediate UI library.
I'm unsure if I'll complete it in the future, below a video of its current state.
